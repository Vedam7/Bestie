      <p>
        I don’t know what kind of magic you carry… but whenever I talk to you, everything feels lighter. Like, my thoughts stop running, my heart slows down — and I just feel... calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have this rare energy — soft but strong, funny but deep, real but dreamy. I don’t say it often, but you’re a little more than just "someone."
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        Maybe the world calls you by your name.<br>
        But to me? You'll always be my fairy & a Bestie — the kind that heals without even trying 💫
